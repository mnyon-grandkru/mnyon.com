I'm a pretty easygoing person, but over the past few months, it seems like even the companies best known for good customer service have slipped a notch or three.  <a href="http://www.twcnyc.net">Speakeasy</a> used to be my ISP; I loved those guys, until I moved from one location to the other and they fumbled and bumbled heir way through an address transfer that took two months to complete.  Meanwhile, I'd moved to Cable and never looked back.<br /><a href="http://www.lingo.com">Vonage</a> who seems to have bought up every third internet ad, should spend the money on their e-commerce implementation, which charged my credit card 17 times within two weeks because they couldn't get their transactions straight.  I spent four hours the phone with them and my bank before they realized that they had a problem.  And now, <a href="http://www.1800flowers.com">FTD.com</a> sends my mother the wrong basket on Mother's day.  If anyone knows of a place where people can keep track of bad customer service experiences with large companies, please let me know.  People deserve better treatment if they're spending their hard earned money or (worse) going depeer into debt.<br /><br />BTW, if you noticed, the URLs for those companies actually go to their competitors. If they're not getting my money, what makes you think they'll get clickthroughs off me either?
