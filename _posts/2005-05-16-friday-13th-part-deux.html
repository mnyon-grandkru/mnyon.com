I had the good pleasure of catching up to Mike and Priscilla on one of their excursions into the city after spending some time celebrating Kate's b-day at <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/37628835/new_york_ny/mannahatta.html?cslink=search_name_cust&amp;ulink=search__searchslot2_520__1_profile_5_1">Mannahatta</a>, which reflects the best of Gentrified, 10.00 per drink <i>East</i> Village. I also met Eva and Chuck, who are a wonderful couple who have broken free from the shackles of Bostonia, are headed out to the Bay, and will see us out on <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">The Playa</a>. Nice house music up in the spot, plus good people, even though the crowd was a bit sparse, and I got some unwanted attention from the male bartender. Donyo and Bryan made it out to part deux, as well. After dancing until they kicked us out, Khari, Mike, Eva and Chuck carried their good energy into the wee hours. I myself headed home, since I was headed up to Albany the next day.
