Thanks to the Burner list; someone on there dropped the dime on <a href="http://www.hopstop.com/">HopStop</a>, a Mapquest based on travel <span style="font-style: italic;">by subway</span>, since most of us in this city don't have a car, and those who do, don't use it. Check it out; makes scheduling travel a lot easier. It evidently even estimates travel based on train speed at the time of day, so it'll take into account the 8AM slowness of the 4 and 5 trains headed downtown.
