People came from far and wide to celebrate your birthday. We all had good food and fun. The top floor at <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7109194/new_york_ny/madame_x.html">Madame X</a> is the only way to celebrate.  The lounge with the nice soft couches were perfect to relax and talk in like adults. <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7104743/new_york_ny/maroons.html">Maroons</a> is a fantastic restaurant as well, with top of the line service. What else can be said?<br /><br /><p> UPDATE: The link is fixed, okay</p>
