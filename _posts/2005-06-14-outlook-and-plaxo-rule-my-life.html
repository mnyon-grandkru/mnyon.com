I wake up in the morning, start up Outlook, review my overdue tasks, push some forward, delete others.  I log onto <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a>, check to see which of my contacts have been updated, sync my tasks for when I'm on the run.  Right now, life looks like a mountain of obligation, a towering stack of Post-It Notes, with rays of sunshine, and the faint aroma of fresh air and a precious life peeking from around the other side of it.  <br /><br />I shouldn't even be typing this; I've got an unorganized apartment, work tasks spilling over to my home life, a load or two of laundry at the laundramat.  I'm just keeping in practice.  With that said, I'm out the door!
