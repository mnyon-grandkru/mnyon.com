Just a quick post to let the world know I got an A on my midterm in <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/summer05/G22.2340-001">Discrete Math</a>.  The class is 2/3 through, and I'm feeling fine.<br /><br />The birthday rush is just about over.  Let's see how many June/July people I wanted/needed to say Happy Birthday to:<br />Jay Lewis<br />Aisha<br />Suzanne Lee<br />Me, Myself and I<br />Matt Smalls<br />Cynthia<br />Chantay<br />Cherie<br />Ryan<br />Jennifer<br /><br />We've got a couple coming up, but that's a lot of birthday cheer; sheeit; I'm going to have to budget for it next year.
