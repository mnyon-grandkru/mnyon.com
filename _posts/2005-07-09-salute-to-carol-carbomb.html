It took me a second to remember how I got this card, but when it came back to me, I couldn't help but chuckle.<br /><br />On one of the weekends when Ish and I went up to see my mom in Albany, we stopped by the one local bars to grab some out of city atmosphere. I'd had enough of people with high minded attitudes scoping out my shoes to see if I'm worth talking to.<br /><br />After a couple of drinks at the local pub, we ran into a very nice couple who loved talking smack and a good drink. As we shared stories of our liquor filled past, (I went over my years lost in <a href="http://www.amiright.com/parody/80s/randynewman6.shtml">Boston</a>), Carol and her man regaled tales of staggering home from various <a href="http://www.albany.com/HotSpot_Lark-Street.cfm">Lark Street</a>.  After 15 minutes of banter back and forth, we somehow ended up having a round of <a href="http://www.cocktail.com/recipes/i/IrishCarBomb.htm">Irish Car Bombs</a> to celebrate good times, past, present and future.<br /><br />Much later, Carol passed us her card, scratched her name out, and wrote down something that would remind us of the afternoon. I do, and if you're out there, I salute you, Carol Carbomb.
