My name is Mark...<br /><br />Here's a quick update on things from my end of the spectrum.  I've been running around, <br /><a href="http://www.miketheheadlesschicken.org/" target="_gfnew">Headless Chicken Style</a>, getting ready for all these weddings (Four, in the span of seven weeks).<br /><br />On another note, I'm still trying to rebuild after having my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" target="_gfnew">iPod</a> crash, my Sidekick crash and my hard drive crash for the second time in a year, losing all documents I had.  I got a big 300 GB network drive and I'm putting together an ultimate archive solution so I never lose anything again.  <br /><br />By the way, if I've taken pictures of you in the past, those pictures are likely gone.  All guilty parties can now breath a sigh of relief ;) This also means that I'll need to get more pictures though.<br /><br />I'll be back with more compelling material shortly.
