During a conversation yesterday over at my friend John and Cori's place nearby, we somehow meandered to the recent press someone had seen about this Hasidic Reggae act, <a href="http://www.hasidicreggae.com" target="_gfnew">Matisyahu</a>.  A deadhead who went to Yeshiva and turned to reggae music, this band has released two CDs to moderate success (about 20,000 copies sold of either of their albums in their 1st six weeks).  I don't know enough about either Ras Tafarianism or Hasidic Judaism to know whether this postmodern culture mashup gets good reviews from the dreads in Bed-Stuy or Jewish cats in Crown Heights, but the general press around the web has been positive.  Check the site out and judge for yourself.<br /><br />On another note, I'm doing the Walk for Diabetes this year.  I went to a wedding for my cousin where I was reminded of how many people in my family have been affected by the disease in one way or another.  I figured I might as well try to do something about it.  My goal is to raise $5,000.00 for this year's walk by October 16th in Riverside Park.  If anyof you are feeling generous and would like to sponsor me, check out my page and drop some loot for a good cause (and it's tax deductible!).<br /><br /><a href="http://main.diabetes.org/site/TR?px=2343948&fl=en_US&s_tafId=23522&pg=personal&fr_id=2748" target="_gfnew">My Donation Page</a>
