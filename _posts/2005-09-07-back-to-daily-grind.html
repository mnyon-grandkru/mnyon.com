Well, I'm back from vacation.  It was absolutely wonderful to get away from everything, to relax and enjoy life outside the daily grind.  School has started as well, so I've gone directly from a vibrant paradise to the same old, same old.  <br /><br />The shock of returning to "normal" life has been multiplied by Hurricane Katrina.  I've given $110 to the <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/arc/site/Donation?ACTION=SHOW_DONATION_OPTIONS&CAMPAIGN_ID=1161&JServSessionIdr011=nviqel0nk1.app17b"   target="_gfnew">Red Cross</a> so far, and I'm going to send some clothing down and figure out other ways to help out.  If you're reading this, I'd advise you to do the same thing.  Find a charity you can support and believe in, take a bit of time and money and <i>do something</i>.  I'm not deluding myself into believing that my contribution by itself will make all the difference in the world, but it's something, and a hell of a lot better than the apathy, indifference and incompetence that has surrounded this disaster.<br /><br />If you decide not to do anything, please do me a favor; don't let me find out about it.  I don't want to hear any sarcasm laden speech complete with cynical filled bullshit about how it won't make a difference anyway.  Especially since some people who read this definitely have the means.
