The whole new mnyon.com's been held up, but I should have something coming for you real soon.  In the meantime, I just wanted to drop some info for you hip-hop heads looking for a good album to cop.  This tidbit just came in from <a href="http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5349" target="_gfnew">Allhiphop.com</a>: The People Under The Stairs are coming out with a new album in May, called <i>Stepfather</i>.  <br /><br />For those I've introduced to the group, you know what this means; more ridiculous beats and laid back, rhymes.  It looks like they're switching labels, but Thes One has also started his own label, called <a href="http://www.tresrecords.com" target="_gfnew">Tres Records</a>.  you can check out music from Thes, Giant Panda and Bloquera.<br /><br />That's it for now....stay tuned!
