So, <br /><br />uptownsound has been up for almost two weeks.  I've been updating playlists every day, going through the vault and finding gems to add. I still have a lot more heavy hitting tracks that haven't made<br /><br />One of the great things about internet radio is the amount of information available to broadcasters.  Since the radio station launched, over 125 hours of streaming music has been downloaded to computers around the world (but mostly in NY and CA).  "My Uzi Weighs A Ton" is the highest rated song out of all, and "Fire In Which You Burn" was the one song that made people stop listening the quickest (I've since removed it from the playlist).<br /><br />I've gotten a few requests, but more feedback is always good.  If you hear a new song on the station, or have some suggestions, hit me up either on this blog or at uptownsound[at]gmail.com.
