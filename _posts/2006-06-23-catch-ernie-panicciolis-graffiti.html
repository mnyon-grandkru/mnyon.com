The evolution of the art form can be traced back to cave painting, believed to be the work of elders and shaman. <br /><b>Propaganda</b> presents graffiti's progression and social pertinence, exhibiting exciting imagery that challenges the imagery of the status quo.&nbsp; </font>&nbsp;<br /><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>DUROCIA</b>, legend and forefather of graffiti, draws inspiration from biblical themes and classic graffiti writing.&nbsp; Duro is critically acclaimed in both graffiti and art communities.&nbsp; Included in the exhibition are paintings depicting iconographic Christian imagery in vibrant pop colors as well as painted model trains referencing the New York City golden years of subway painting.&nbsp; The work evokes at once nostalgia and innovation. <br /></font><br /><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>SLANG TYRUE,</b> renowned Chicago graffiti artist, blends traditional graffiti lines and arrows with figure drawing and cubism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slang refers to his carefully designed and expressive style as "slangism".&nbsp; On display will be large-scale paintings that address how Americans are unwitting slaves to mass consumption. <br /></font><br /><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#ff0033" size="3"><strong>Famed Hip-Hop photographer ERNIE PANICCIOLI, will showcase 15 photographs of graffiti and graffiti artist taken over a span of 30 years in various locations ranging from New York's five boroughs, the American South and Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Though polished in presentation this work retains much of its authentic street flair.
