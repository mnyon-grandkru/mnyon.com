Hey all,<br /><br />It's been a long time since I wrote anything in here.  The truth is, between my new company, school, my engagement (yup, I'm getting married), there's been a lot going on.  Much too much to handle at times. Hopefully this'll be the beginning of a comeback.<br /><br />I just wanted to take a second to point people at this parody crunk song called "Read A Book!".  You know how Lil' Jon and the Ying Yang Twins scream all sorts of nonsense over a beat?  This is like that, but the lyrics are a bit different.  Here are some examples.<br /><br />"Read a book, read a book, read a motherfucking book!"<br /><br />"your body needs water so drink that shit!"<br /><br />"raise your kids, raise your kids, raise your goddam kids!"<br /><br />Read A Book is available <a href="http://www.myspace.com/knotarapper">here</a>. I'm trying to get it added to my playlist at <a href="http://www.live365.com/stations/uptownsound">Forever True School</a>.
