Rest, relaxation, recovery and rediscovery. Should be a hell of a time to reflect on a hell of a year (most of which is not reflected in this blog whatsoever, so if you want an entertaining tale of trial and tribulation, send me an email).  I'm really looking forward to this as well as being recharged for 2007.  Happy Holidays and Merry New Year! to anyone I didn't get in touch with.  Peace.
