I was using <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa's</a> BlogThis! feature to post an update on our time in Accra. Having lost approximately 300 words, I'm going to redo this in a concise manner. This is a picture of us before eating at the Continental at <a href="http://www.gbhghana.com/lapalm.html">La Palm Hotel</a> in Accra. We went with Aisha's aunt Gloria and uncle Mensa and their son, Worlanyo. The buffet was decent, but not spectacular. Worla passed out in the car after the meal due to jetlag, while we walked through the Ghanian Village, a restaurant designed to look like a northern Ghanian village. We then drove home through the <a href="http://accra.wantedinafrica.com/area_description.php?id_area=355">Teshie/Nungua</a> neighborhood, which vividly reminded us that Ghana's more than gated communities with private pools.  More later.
