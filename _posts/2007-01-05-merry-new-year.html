So 2007 is upon us, leaving behind a crazy, exciting, challenging 2006. The good, the bad and the ugly was heaped upon my plate. I got the courage to leave a comfy but frustrating job and start my own venture. I also got engaged, and am happy to start building a life with a special woman. I made it to the motherland and enjoyed life like I haven't in a long time.<br /><br />On the other hand, I also gave myself high blood pressure by trying to do too much in too little time. Sleeping three hours a night for two months at a stretch may work for those early 20 year olds, but I just can't do it anymore. I'm going to get things done by taking it easy. I'm not going to make any resolutions per se, but just change directions as needed.<br /><br />On another note, the trip to Ghana was fantastic. We've got about 400 pictures and lots of thoughts to chew on. Future blog posts will be titled "Reflections of Ghana:" with a specific subject.<br /><br />Watch this space.
