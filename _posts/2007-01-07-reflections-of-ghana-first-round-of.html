The first round of pics from our vacation are up and available at <a href="http://www2.snapfish.com/share/p=37661168149237084/l=236585496/g=35345819/otsc=SYE/otsi=SALB">Snapfish</a>; go and check them out. We took over 400 in total, it's likely that 250 - 300 will make the final cut.  These are an account of our travels in Accra, Cape Coast and Ho. <br /><br />My trusty camera that I've banged on for years died on the day that we visited the slave castle in Cape Coast. If anyone has recommendations for a new digital camera, pass them on.
