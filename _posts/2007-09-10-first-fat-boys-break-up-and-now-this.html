I've gotten so domesticated. Between that and <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu">school</a>, <a href="http://www.grandkru.com">work</a>, <a href="http://www.forever-true-school.com">the radio station</a> and assorted odds and ends, there's barely time to breathe. So you won't be seeing me on my favorite emails lists or at my favorite parties for awhile, I'm afraid. If you need to reach me, try the contact information you've got. I'll hit you up as soon as I can.
