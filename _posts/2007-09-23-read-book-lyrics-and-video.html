I've just recently realized that most people are linking to this site looking for the lyrics or video to the "Read a Book" song. Now that the video's out, it's gained a lot of traction, which is good. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.hiphopmusic.com/2007/08/jesse_jackson_on_the_read_a_bo.html">Jesse Jacskson</a> doesn't think much of the piece. I guess the Fresh Prince was right; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI0dCVwdedE">Parents Just Don't Understand</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't have these on my blog, but you can see the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN2VqFPNS8w">here</a>. For those who have problems figuring out the words and want lyrics, you can get them <a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/bonami_dmite_armah_lyrics_16553/other_lyrics_47275/read_a_book_lyrics_509432.html">here</a>.<br /><br />Finally, if you want to hear some good hip-hop, check out my radio station <a href="http://www.live365.com/stations/uptownsound?play">here</a>.<br /><br />"Cause when you take that bus...you get there"
