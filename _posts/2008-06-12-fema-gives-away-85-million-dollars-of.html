This goes into the "I can't make this shit up" category. Straight from CNN.<br /><br />"FEMA gave away about $85 million in household goods meant for Hurricane Katrina victims, a CNN investigation has found.<br /><br />These items, stored by FEMA, were meant for Katrina victims but were given to state and federal agencies.<br /><br />The material, from basic kitchen goods to sleeping necessities, sat in warehouses for two years before the Federal Emergency Management Agency's giveaway to federal and state agencies this year."<br /><br />In other news, I got a letter from the government the other day. I opened and read it. It said they were suckers!<br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/06/11/fema.giveaway/index.html
