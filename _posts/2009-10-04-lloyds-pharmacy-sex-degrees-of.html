So I was going through my blogroll the other day, and while on a relationship blog site <a href="http://www.nakedwithsockson.com/2009/09/29/i-slept-with-over-4-million-people/">Naked With Socks On</a>, I see a post about the <a href="http://calculators.lloydspharmacy.com/sexdegrees/index.aspx">Lloyds Pharmacy Sex Degrees of Separation Calculator</a>. If you enter your age and number of partners, and age of each partner, it'll tell you how many partners with which you have indirectly had relations. There's at least an exponential difference between the number of direct and indirect partners, so the final result will be higher than expected. The purpose of the calculator is to heighten safe sex awareness.
