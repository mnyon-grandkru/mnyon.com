So I have a small business. My premium for my healthcare plan with United Healthcare (via Oxford) is $803.91 per month with the Freedom Standard Plan for a husband and wife. Oxford is proposing to increase the same plan with the same benefits by 18.75% to $948.62. Maybe it's because <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=UNH#chart1:symbol=unh;range=1y;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">UnitedHealth Group</a> had a rocky year (the stock is still a little over 10% up year to year between 11.03.2008 and 11.03.2009. I'm amazed at this jump, which is an increase on last year's 11% premium jump from 2008 to 2009. I'm amazed that the company has the temerity to ask for that degree of increase in a year when healthcare reform is on the table. <br />
<br />
To me, it means that the healthcare companies already know that there's no significant reform on the horizon. Either that, or when the reform comes about, the plan prices will be about the same as before.<br />
<br />
Now, I need to do more research and figure out how the proposed legislation will affect these premiums, but right not, I feel pretty cynical about what's being done to my wallet. <br />

If anyone has a list of alternative smallbiz HSA plans, hook a brother up.
