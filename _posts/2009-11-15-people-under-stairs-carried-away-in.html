Normally there's more of a gap in between <a href="http://www.putsonline.co.uk">People Under The Stairs</a> releases, but when I went to check up on them to see when they were due back in NYC, I was very pleased to discover that they had a new album out, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%255Fss%255F1%255F12%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpeople%2520under%2520the%2520stairs%2520carried%2520away%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3DPeople%2520Under&tag=fortrusch-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Carried Away</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=fortrusch-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>.<br />
<br />
Now, whenever I get a new PUTS album, I generally take everything else out of rotation, and rock the new plate exclusively for a few days, at least until I get a sense of which tracks are going to stay with me for a long time. The beats just keep getting better and better from this duo. I'm really surprised that they don't end up doing production for more people, but perhaps it's for the best, because the beats on the first three songs, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xdQmojdfE0">Step Off</a>,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtDlV8Bo5sk">Much Too Much</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpHLDdh-i60">Hit The Top</a> got me nodding my head at work. The lead single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Ct12ZGJL4">Trippin' At The Disco!!!</a> is an ode to the 70's Disco done with a hilarious video. Add treats like "Beer" and "Teeth" into the mix, and ending up with a haunting title track, it looks like the boys from LA have done it again.<br />
<br />
I can't think of many groups who have been doing it so well for 11 years and 7 albums. Cop this album and put some dough in these guy's pockets. Then check out the back catalog. Also, go see them when they're in your town. It'll be worth the show fee. Check the tour review from <a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/download-hot-rappers-people-under-stairs">Spin Magazine</a>
