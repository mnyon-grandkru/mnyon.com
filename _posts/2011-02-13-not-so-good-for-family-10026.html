It looks like the restaurants in Harlem are not doing so well, according to amNY's interpretation of the report results. Here's the amNY <a href="http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/dirty-dining-manhattan-nabes-that-serve-up-the-most-health-violations-1.2671873">article</a>, and here's the actual report from the NYC Restaurant Inspection <a href="http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do">site</a>. Enter 10026 as a zipcode and you get 50 results. It's unfortunate that this article came out, but if these are accurate, then people have a right to make sure that they're getting good value for the places where they eat. Personally, I'm going to renew my commitment to make and eat more food at home; it's for the best.
