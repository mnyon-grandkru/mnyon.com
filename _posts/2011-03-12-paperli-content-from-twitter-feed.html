If you like your information delivered in an old school format, <a href="http://paper.li">paper.li</a> will take your twitter feed and create a newspaper out of it. My daily paper is <a href="http://paper.li/scorintha">here</a>. It's a reminder of just how much information gets sent around in these 140 character tweets.
