Earlier this year, I was honored to be asked to join the board of a non-profit named The LAMP (thelampnyc.org), which is dedicated to media reform as holding workshops in media literacy across the city, in particular new media (like this platform we're on now). 

The LAMP is in its annual fundraising drive, and all we're asking for is $11 in order to help fund more programs and workshops that help people to turn a more informed and critical eye towards the messages we receive every day. Any amount is appreciated. If you prefer to donate online, here's a link to check out: http://www.nycharities.org/donate/c_donate.asp?CharityCode=2282. Otherwise, get in touch with me and we can set something up. Thanks, and Happy Holidays in advance!
