It's been a heck of an almost two years since I've added anything to this blog. I've been using the social media sites, trying to understand that world as much as possible. While those have been useful, I've also noted some changes in the way information is spread and stored that leads me to want to explore avenues beyond those sites, including blasts from the past, like this Blogger piece of real estate right here.<br />

Evidently Blogger's not been left behind in the desire to migrate to the <a href="http://plus.google.com/">plus</a>, and I need to figure out how to get with the times. Watch this space...</div>
