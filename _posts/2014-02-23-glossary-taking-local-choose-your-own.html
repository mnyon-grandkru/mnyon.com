<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's time for another <a href="http://www.mnyon.com/p/glossary.html" target="_blank">Glossary</a> installment; this week, we'll tackle "Taking the Local" and "Choose Your Own Adventure".</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Taking the local" - Have you ever said something that was witty, yet obscure enough that it takes people some time to get it? When the comprehension dawns in their eyes, I tend to refer to that time it takes slow people to catch up as "taking the local", as opposed to the time it generally takes to connect the dots on slang or meta-slang.<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Mercer" target="_blank">PosDnuos</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.wearedelasoul.com/" target="_blank">De La Sou</a>l as an emcee kicks a lot of rhymes that make people take the local. To quote a couple of lines from the fantastic single "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMoHezlA0a0" target="_blank">Stakes Is High</a>"...</span><i style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">"I be a piece of the East Coast, so give a toast to Plug Wonder Why / Back in the day who soaked his words in ginger / <b>So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December </b>(emphasis added)"</i><span style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span><br /><br />I'd venture that there are people who are still trying to figure out some of his lyrics 20 years later.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">"Choose Your Own Adventure" - Sometimes your friends will ask you your opinion on a matter where they have made up their own mind already and are seeking validation. Sometimes, it's not possible to agree with said opinion, especially if said opinion is something like "if someone isn't clear on whether they like me, I should make a grand display to show them how I feel","We haven't talked about expectations for this sex party, but I'm sure it'll work out", "They've got some problems, but I'm sure my love will help them get to a better place", or "driving my car with just my feet is fun!". At that point, if someone seems determined to defend their bad decision to the end, I realize that I cannot change their mind, and I also don't want to participate in their rebellion verification session. So, the best response that comes to my mind is "Choose your own adventure". It's a reminder that the decision you made was yours, and yours alone, so I hope it works out.</span></li>
