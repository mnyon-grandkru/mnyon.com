Now for something new; I post a little something about music treats and gems that I've discovered over the years. These are songs and/or mixes that I come back to in my music collection time &amp; time again. It's also a convenient place to put music recommendations whenever friends ask.<br />
<br />
First up on the list; the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fake-blood/sets/the-used-series-vols-1-6" target="_blank">USED</a>&nbsp;mixtape series from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Keating" target="_blank">Fake Blood</a>. This series blew my mind as an electronic music fan whose first love was Hip-Hop. These mixes are pleasurable not only for the background behind the Hip-Hop classic from yesteryear, Fake Blood actually plays the 12" on 1200 and proceeds to make the loop of that sample on the 1s and 2s, so you hear both the original song as well as the sample(s) that came from that song.<br />
<br />
Each mix is a journey through old soul, rock, jazz and other obscure genres and makes for nice mellow background music to accompany your day.<br />
<br />
Check these mixes out below and let me know what you think.<br />
