<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">There are a few favored flavors that I have enjoyed for as long as I can remember, and will stay with me until the end of time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_pepper" target="_blank">Lemon Pepper</a>&nbsp;goes on top of rice, eggs and almost any combination of veggies. Ginger goes greatly with many things. Sriracha has got me covered anytime I want some heat on my plate.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">Two foods that always tasted great together are Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate. The first candy I remember sliding down my throat were Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Back then, you could have the two pack of <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/06/the-history-of-reeses-peanut-butter-cups/" target="_blank">Reese's Peanut Butter Cups</a>, Reese's Pieces, or the mini Reese's Cups. I used to pick up one every week when I picked up my weekly Marvel Comics (60 cents each).&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">I remember running into <a href="https://www.littledebbie.com/107.82/Nutty-Bars" target="_blank">Nutty Buddy</a>&nbsp;(pka Nutty Bars), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twix" target="_blank">Peanut Butter Twix</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PB_Max" target="_blank">PB Max</a>&nbsp;throughout the 90s and 2000s. There were a few choices, but not a plethora of options. I mean, the local candy shops like <a href="http://www.krausescandy.com/" target="_blank">Krause's Candy Shop</a>&nbsp;held me down with custom chocolate peanut butter candies, but that was just during my time spent upstate (in high school).</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">At some point in the past decade, the number of Peanut Butter candies has expanded. There are several brands of <a href="http://shop.justins.com/Dark-Chocolate-Peanut-Butter-Cups/p/JNB-000254" target="_blank">Organic</a> <a href="https://www.theochocolate.com/specialty/peanut-butter-cups" target="_blank">Peanut</a> <a href="http://www.newmansown.com/foods/milk-chocolate-peanut-butter-cups/" target="_blank">Butter</a> Cups out there, as well as peanut butter versions of <a href="https://www.snickers.com/product/pb2" target="_blank">Snickers</a>, <span id="goog_1952673692"></span><a href="http://www.mms.com/us/product/pb" target="_blank">M&amp;M<span id="goog_1952673693"></span>s</a>, <a href="https://www.butterfinger.com/products/details/11559" target="_blank">Butterfingers</a>, and almost anything else you can imagine. There's even a Peanut Butter Burger in a bar in NYC.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">While my Chocolate Peanut Butter intake has slowed down and likely will (shout out to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/type-2-diabetes" target="_blank">Type-2 Diabietes</a>&nbsp;in the family), I do want to spend some time reflecting upon different Peanut Butter Chocolate candies over the years. A full rundown of Reese's History, the short lived PB Max and more esoteric Peanut Butter Chocolate candies out there.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: verdana, sans-serif;">I'll have more to say about this as time gores on, but for now, watch this space...</span><br />
