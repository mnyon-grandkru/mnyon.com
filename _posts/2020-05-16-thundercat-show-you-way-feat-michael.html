Here's a track I didn't know I needed in my life until I heard about it. While I've been a <a href="https://flying-lotus.com/">FlyLo</a> fan for awhile, I've not explored Thundercat's catalog. There also&nbsp; seems to be a tenderness to his music, at least based upon what I've heard so far.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The video is a bit heavier than I expected, but the message is heartfelt and welcome in these uncertain times.<br />
<br />
I plan on unwinding with this song and diving through my music collection for other yacht rock acts. If you've got time, let Thundercat Show You The Way.
