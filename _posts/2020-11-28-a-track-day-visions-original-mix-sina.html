<p>Every once in awhile, I come across a track while listening to a mix that captures my attention. I'll pull out my phone to <a href="https://SoundHound.com" target="_blank">SoundHound</a> or <a href="https://Shazam.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shazam</a> the track. I’ll add it to my Momentary Bliss playlist and perhaps play it on repeat for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes the song can't be found that way. There are several magical pieces of music that are still waiting to be named and discovered from early mornings in Shelter, Guernica, Plant Bar, and many other places.</p><p>Sometimes these agents of discovery do find the particular track I'm seeking. Connects a song to a name, a creator, a backstory and possibly more music to enjoy.</p><p>I was catching up on my <a href="https://www.deepershades.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deeper Shades of House </a>mixes and awaiting the one particular song that has caught the a DJ’s attention this week. Lars tends to place his momentary bliss track(s) somewhere between the 20 and 40 minute mark of his hour long mixes.</p><p>At least, that’s how the music affects me.</p><p><a href="https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/A8x3ZMk9UY5Ab9ms7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visions (Original Mix)</a> is the dopest deep house song I’ve heard in a minute from a person with their role in their name. Sina made a nice, mellow track that good rhythm, nice pads and a vocal sample for a hook (a good vocal sample gets me almost every time). &nbsp;It is a nice addition to a relaxed weekend afternoon. &nbsp;Enjoy.</p><p><br /></p>
