<p>I ran into this song whilst in the midst of a <a href="https://chillhop.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chillhop</a> mix. The New Jack City guitar lick punctuating the beat in the midst of those keys. The rambling, reverberated piano pleasantly meandering over the beat, which remains steady as she goes. The short play time guarantees at least a couple of replays every time I come back to this.</p>

<p>
As much as I love this song, it has the feeling of capturing a moment, a vibe or a groove. A high note in an opera solo. A soothing quenching drink hitting the back of the throat. I'll enjoy it for as long as I can before moving on, knowing that I'll be back for more later. Stretching it out too long would ruin what makes it so great to me.
