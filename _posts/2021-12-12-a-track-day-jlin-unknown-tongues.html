<p>One of my music nerd friends sent me this piece on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/09/1060476653/i-dont-think-about-the-dance-floor-jlins-complicated-rhythms">JLin</a>.  Checking out her <a href="https://youtu.be/cxPBqUh3kSU">Carbon 7</a> video, I started talking with my other music nerds. One noted that the lack of structure was a bit of a disconnect for them.</p>

<p>This contrasted with my perception; I'm a fan of unconventional structures in a lot of forms, and I feel like that's how I experience Jlin's songs. When I brought that up, they clarified that they had meant song structure. A hook, a bridge. Elements that portray a journey.</p>

<p>That made total sense to me...and yet, when I heard that, I wanted to thank Madlib, MF Doom, Flying Lotus, Brock Berrigan and Bonobo. Appreciating their catalog helps me appreciate the journey in "Unknown Tongues"</p>
