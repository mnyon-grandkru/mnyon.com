<p>Everyone knows the singles to the big albums when they come out. You don't have to worry about the Roots because They Got You. The Fugees Killed You Softly. Digable Planets gave Slick a new life being Cool Like That.</p>
<p>Going past the splash of the singles, I could find smooth grooves for cool moods. This mellow bop with a little funk in its strut wouldn't seem out of place on the Low End Theory. These Digable cats made their own mellow hypotheses with relaxed, yet hypnotic rhymes that would fit in your room...or on the moon. Either/or. </p>
<p>I'm done writing for now. Trying to make this appointment.</p>
