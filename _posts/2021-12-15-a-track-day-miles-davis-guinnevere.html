<P>I found Circle In the Round during college; it was a trusty cassette that got a lot of burn during study times. At this time, I'd heard <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/5460-Miles-Davis-Kind-Of-Blue">Kind of Blue</a>; I hadn't yet heard <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/8260-Miles-Davis-Bitches-Brew">Bitches Brew</a>. I think it would have been a worthy addition, but I don't have a time machine so I couldn't have made that possible.</P>
<P>If nothing else, this languid, ethereal musician All-Star Jam (we had Miles, Herbie Hancock, and Chick Corea amongst others on this track written by <i>David Crosby</i>) provided a vibe that is screwed without the promethazine, but not chopped.  A fluid soundscape treat for the ears. It was great to relax, and ... one other thing.</P>
<p>In the 90s when I found this track, I was primarily an underground hip-hop head who HATED R&amp;B. It go no run in my stereo, and I'd sometimes pull it out of other people's tape decks (ah, misguided youth). So if someone was coming over for quality time, I sure as hell wasn't playing Jodeci. What did I play? Click play above and find out.</p>
