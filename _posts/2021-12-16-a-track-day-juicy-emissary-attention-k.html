<p>This one's for the diggers. The beat heads who look for really obscure records. I'll quote from the single description for the background behind this.
  <blockquote>
    On Thanksgiving 1989, Kmart employee and audio enthusiast Mark Davis wandered behind the customer service desk to check out the store’s sound system, which looped muzak and top 40 plus ads and announcements under the banner of “KMRT, The Kmart Radio Network.” When he found last month’s tape hadn’t been thrown out yet, he pocketed it and made a habit of doing this, collecting 56 tapes from 1989-1992.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In September 2015, Davis uploaded the tapes to archive.org with the humble intention of preserving them. But within a few weeks he became an internet celebrity among obscure media fans and supplemented the collection with reel-to-reel tapes from the 70s and 80s thanks to Tom Schwarzrock, who acquired them serendipitously along with a deck he purchased. The tapes are like a consumerist time capsule, a vaporwave trove of eerily familiar corporate ephemera extracted from its original context and purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Similarly, Attention Kmart Choppers is composed of pieces from this collection chopped up, resculpted, and mosaicked together by Juicy The Emissary, forming a new, distinctly contemporary sound while inheriting a haunting nostalgia that provokes memories burrowed deep in the subconscious.

<p>P.S; I remember producing segments for a show called "Voices on the Park", which was to be a jazz show that would be broadcast on a fledgling station available only to Nokia phones in Central Park. I believe some friends and I taped 2 - 4 segments</p>.
<p>P.P.S; I wonder if Juicy The Emissary had ever possessed a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_Marketing">Lifestyle Marketing</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thes_One">Thes One</a>, which was released in 2007?</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. 5:39. You're welcome</p>
