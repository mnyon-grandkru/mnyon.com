<p>I was listening to a DJ Jazzy Jeff mix where Jeff first played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XF5jW8p7Qo">Mirandolina</a> before blending into this flip above. I'm generally a fan of interpolated voice samples, and those reeled me in at the beginning. I'm not as sure if it's as well known as his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kaytranada/janet-jackson-if-kaytranada">other Janet Jackson Remix</a>, but what they share is a creative soundscape that remains true to the source material by making me want to dance.</p>
<p>As I do as much of a two step as my healng knee will allow, the words "Alright" come through the sound. Sometimes I put this track on both Serato decks and crossfade so I can hear that word repeatedly. "Alright (Alright)". Some days it's for the fun of sound. Other times it's a comforting embrace in a cold world. It's all right with me.</p>
