<p>I love the groove of this track. I have looked high and low and have not been able to find any sequiturs in the lyrics, whether ScHoolboy's or Anderson's.  It doesn't matter though; it sounds like a track where a producer might have spliced separate samples & voices, and is just performing all of them, as the band would likely do live.</p>
<p>This gem came through to my ears during a Jazzy Jeff mix. He was geeked out about a possible Anderson Paak / Bruno Mars album. Had me thinking abour how I'm really thankful for listening to DJ Jazzy Jeff during this pandemic. If someone who's got such a storied history with music enjoys all sorts of music regardless of popularity, genre, label, I can tell my inner record store employee to take a hike with his pitchfork playlist, sit my ass down, and think about a warm summer night in a post covid town in the future where I'm about to head on out for the night. Even the casio horn stabs at the end fit into the scenario. So precious.</a>
