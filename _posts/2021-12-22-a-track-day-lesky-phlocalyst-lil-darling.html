<p>I'm not sure when or where I found or liked this on SoundCloud. Don't remember where I first heard it. This track is four years old, and that's as much info as I have. I'mm happy about the decisions that I made at the time, however. I've also started <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user4950160-1">reposting</a> these tracks on SoundCloud.</p>
<p>I see this song being performed in a large abandoned warehouse on a rainy day during springtime. Low volume, heavily but not too heavily reverbed out keys, drums, bass and all. The key chords drive the song. Simple, sweet, serene. The applause at the beginning would be equally well served at the end.</p>
