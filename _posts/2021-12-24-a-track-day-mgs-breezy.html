<p>This came across my ears while checking out a mix of <a href="https://youtu.be/podoObTg5sQ">Stax Singles 1964 - 1975</a>. The guitar lick reminded me of Mr. Big Stuff, perhaps a good song for transition on the 1s and 2s. The B3 notes take center stage, until the guitar comes in heavier later on in the track. The instrumental fades off at a moment where the musicians are kinda just getting started</p>
<p>This song came out the year I was born. It was released during the Al Bell years, after Booker T. had left and moved out west. The MGs stayed on with Stax Records. After Al Jackson passed away, the band members did a lot of session music work before showing up as the Blues Brothers Band that performed in the movie of the same name.</p>
