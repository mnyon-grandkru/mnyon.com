<p>I was a young kid, learning piano and keyboards. Somewhere around this time, my mother saved enough money to get me a <a href="https://www.vintagesynth.com/yamaha/dx11.php">DX11</a> synthesizer and an <a href="https://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/mmt8.php">MMT-8</a> sequencer. I remember tinkling the keys with a four operator FM synth version of a "piano" sound in time to the beginning of the song. "Do-dododo-dodo; dodododododo". Simple songs for singalongs. This is a pop song in all its phases.</p>
<p>While the video single caught my attention with the nice romance story, I spent more time listening to the album version on cassette, sandwiched between a live version of a more frenetic song called "Broken". It makes for a good contrast because this song is relaxed & well put together. </p>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world">I don't always do karaoke, but when I do</a>, this is my first or second song I put onto the playlist.</p>
