<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Worrell">P-Funk</a> had played at Tufts my sophomore year in college. Meeting a woman who followed P-Funk like others followed the Dead was my first taste of professional hedonistic excess. After getting my first Parliament and Funkadelic albums, I delved deeper into musicians' individual albums.</p>
<p>Can't Stay Away is one of the singles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahh..._The_Name_Is_Bootsy%2C_Baby!">Ahh.. The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!</a>. It's a mellow, unrepentant love song for someone (or something) special. It starts in a major key with sunny declarations of devotion before shifting into a minor key, showcasing longing with a simple refrain "Can't stay away...I just can't stay away (can't stay A WAY!)"</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Worrell">Bernie Worrell</a> shows his virtuosity by doing whatever he likes on the keys on this track, and it blends with a steady drum beat and somewhat subdued guitar during both the major and minor keys in this song.</p>
