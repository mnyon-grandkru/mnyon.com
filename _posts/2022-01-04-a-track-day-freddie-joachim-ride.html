<p> In the <a href="https://www.mnyon.com/2022/01/a-track-day-j-live-longevity.html">previous post</a>, I discussed a track on Mushroom Jazz Vol. 1. While a deeper dive does deserve its own post, I can say that there are eight official releases and dozens of other mixtapes on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/djmarkfarina/sets/mushroom-jazz-mixes">Sound Cloud</a>. Over all these releases and twenty years, there's only been one song that I have really disliked. The rest of these songs have been chill, or fire depending on what slang you want to use.  The major releases have come out years apart.</p>
<p>The thing about creating your own lane is that over time, it's easy to identify people who fit into that lane, or mood. When I first heard <a href="https://freddiejoachim.com/">Freddie Joachim</a>, I was going through the catalog of a lot of producers I enjoyed, like <a href="http://tallblackguyproductions.com/">Tall Black Guy</a> and <a href="https://ericlau.bandcamp.com/">Eric Lau</a>. I heard this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/weheartbeat/stay-mellow-sa-mixed-by">mix</a> in 2013 and it flows well with a lot of known and unknown tracks. In addition to lesser known tracks from well known artists like Talib Kweli, MF DOOM and Madlib, there were a lot of instrumentals that had a hint (or more) of Jazz over some solid boom bap, at a mellow pace.</p>
<p>With Ride in particular (which starts at 4:32 of the mix), the solid yet subtle bass, the horn synths and the vocal chants bring me happiness. This is the kind of song that I'd love to come on a few hours into a road trip down a highway with no police for miles on a bright, sunny day.</p>
<p>Just like Mushroom Jazz.</p>
<p>I remember telling my friends at the time "Freddie Joachim makes music that could be on Mushroom Jazz". Three years later, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/8862154-DJ-Mark-Farina-Mushroom-Jazz-Eight">Mushroom Jazz 8</a> is released. Guess who has some smooth ass beats and three songs on Mushroom Jazz 8? You guessed it, and so did I. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO3CaJieLK8">I love it when a plan comes together.</a></p>
