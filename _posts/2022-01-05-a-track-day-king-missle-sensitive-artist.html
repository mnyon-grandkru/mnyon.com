<p><a href="http://kingmissile.com/">King Missle</a> was one of my favorite bands from way back in high school days. With a melody that is vaguely reminiscient of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYxCF6vHDok">Guantanamera</a>, adding an accompanying harmonica with sporadic xylophone in the background, this spoken word piece encapsulates a personality type I would run into a lot over the years. The words speak volumes, as does this Genius attribution about them below:</p>

<p>Fluting on the Hump and Mystical Shit were my favorite King Missle albums, although they gained some modest acclaim a few years later with their single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachable_Penis">Detachable Penis</a>. "Take Stuff From Work", "Gary and Melissa", "Jesus was Way Cool" were some of my favorites. Silly & surreal storytelling combined with notes of observational comedy. Definitely helpful to lighten a mood.</p>
