<p>I found this quote which resonated with me while cruising through social media.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en">French house music from like 96 - 2000 is on the perfect fault line of camp ridiculousness and deepness. It's not cool but I love that shit. Gonna listen to Super Discount again maybe.</p>— C.Scott (@CScott412) <a href="https://twitter.com/CScott412/status/1479144075743924230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> 
<p>"Love Love Mode" was the first track that came to my mind. The vocal sample non-sequiturs serving as instruments, the accordion &amp; other synths playing various roles on the track, the simple ditties that take center stage at some points of the track. It all comes together in a package that is entertaining and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is an undervalued quality in music nowadays.</p>
<p>Give it a listen if you're in the mood for something fun and easy on the ears. It's definitely a nice break from news & current events.</p>
