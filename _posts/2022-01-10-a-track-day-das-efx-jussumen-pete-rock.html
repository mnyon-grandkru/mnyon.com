<p>"Well I'm the Jibber...Jabber"</p>
<p>It felt like EPMD could do no wrong in 1992. Not only did their album "Business Never Personal" come out, but it seemed like their proteges were unstoppable as well; K-solo had people spellbound before DMX, Redman had introduced himself to the world, and then there was Das-Efx, this duo from down in Virginia that didn't sound like anyone else at the time.</p>
<p>They added "iggity" to their words, and had enough pop culture references to make a battle rap fan proud (or would those be considered "current event bars"?). Their in house production team seemed to take guidance from E Double, but they had their own spin on things (which everyone, including Ice Cube, subsequently copied).</p>
<p>The original verison of the song has a nice soundscape, with the guitar lick and some nice heavy drums, but this remix...</p>
<p>I very likely heard this for the first time on the <a href="https://www.wers.org/">WERS Hip-Hop Show</a> from 8 - 11 PM. Pete Rock found some horns to sprinkle throughout the track, and that scale exercise down the keys adds a meaty melody to the mix</p>
<p>This track was a little unappreciated in its original form (or as unappreciated as a no-skip album from 1992 could be), but when Pete did his thing on the remix, it became a reason to have the tape deck on record, waiting for the possibility that this song might come on again. Getting singles that had just come out felt like capturing lightning in a bottle.</p>
