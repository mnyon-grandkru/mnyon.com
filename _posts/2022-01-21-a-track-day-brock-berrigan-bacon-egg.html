<p>I first ran into <a href="http://www.brockberrigan.com/">Brock Berrigan</a> during a <a href="https://chillhop.com/">Chillhop Music</a> mix.  This song has a generally pleasant soundscape, accentuated by what would come to be known as signatures of Brock's style; boom-bap inspired hip-hop mixed with filtered repeated fill ins, sound effects, samples from video games, laser, a kitchen sink, a government that believes in voting rights for all; all sorts of unbelievable shit.</p>
<p>Back to the music. I've mentioned in previous <a href="https://www.mnyon.com/2021/12/a-track-day-jlin-unknown-tongues.html">blogs</a> that Brock Berrigan's work has been a big part of my journey through a lot of electrionica in the past few years. There are also a few parallels to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Doom">MF DOOM</a>. Oh word? Don't believe me? Here's my evidence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They're both producers with prodigious work</li>
  <li>They've both flipped well known samples in unique ways</li>
  <li>They both wear masks; MF DOOM is always rocking the metal, and Brock is a little <a href="https://www.stereofox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brock-berrigan-interview.jpg">Cocky</a> (SFW, FWIW)</li>
  <li>Many of their best songs sonically are barely longer than two minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like this song, let [insert music program here] guide you through the rest of his catalog as a nice background to a studious or relaxing day. This is definitely a sunshine song, in my book.</p>
