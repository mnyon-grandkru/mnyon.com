<p>This track is just plain wonderful. The percussion mixes with a warm, comfy bassline. The piano-like chords set the table for Evar's voice to hold court, or mingle with the flute, which drops in and out through the track. Hazy horns also show up to accentuate the song as well.</p>
<p>I first heard this track on <a href="https://www.deepershades.net/dsoh-shows/deeper-shades-of-house-695-guest-mix-by-sgvo.html">Deeper Shades of House mix #695</a>. It was this song where I noticed that <a href='https://www.deepershades.net/larsbehrenroth'>Lars</a> would play a song that would either stop me in my tracks, or make myself move somewhere between the 35 - 40th minute. Each track that fit that category had something undeniable to it. This song definitely fits in that category.</p>
<p>One other thing about the song; the lyrics bring to mind times people spent gathering for good vibes and visions. It provides positivty without being preachy. Combine that with well spaced titular refrains and we've got a pleasant sound palette.</p>
