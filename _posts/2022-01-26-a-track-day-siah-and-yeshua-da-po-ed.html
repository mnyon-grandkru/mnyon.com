<p>That song I wrote about <a href="https://www.mnyon.com/2022/01/a-track-day-janes-addiction-ted-just.html">yesterday</a> reminded me of something. I've got a playlist called "Change The Beat" dedicated to songs that change part way through. If the whole mix was a group jam like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hiphop-classics1/a-tribe-called-quest-ft?in=hiphop-classics1/sets/early-90s-hardcore-rap">Scenario</a>, this song would go at the end like a Busta Rhymes verse.</p>
<p>This had to be another <a href="https://wers.org/">WERS special</a>, as college DJs were more likely to play a 10 minute opus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siah_and_Yeshua_DapoED">Siah and Yeshua Dapo ED</a> was one of those Fondle 'Em releases that had people listening. Thanks Stretch & Bobbito.</p>
<p>On this song, Siah & Yeshua weave one long tale over multiple beats. The instrumental could double as a producer's beat tape, as they include with a vaudevillian organ based joint, some familiar samples flipped a lil bit differently, some pensive & contemplative, others filled with action (and some dope scratching).</p>
<p>The rhymes? These MC's had a new pocket every bar (or less), and did it so fluidly that they made it work. Peep (from <a href="https://genius.com/Siah-and-yeshua-dapoed-a-day-like-any-other-lyrics">Genius</a>:<br>
  <blockquote>
    I felt the life of the cipher, but this (yo) time with a twist<br>
Sensin' this sense I'm on defense<br>
I knew a miss meant death, rhymin' to save our breath<br>
Was the only path left to take so we took<br>
Siah pulled out his book full of remedies<br>
An arsensal capable of cuttin' many extremities<br>
Lettin' these beasts know when he released flow<br>
Then foes be easily defeated<br>
So Siah been spittin' writtens, none survivin'<br>
The shit was hittin', he asked a few to dive in his mind<br>
They drowned, looked around and found<br>
A scimitar on some next page and got down<br>
Splittin' crown, back-to-back attack on these clown half-breeds<br>
In fact he didn't even ask me to jump in<br>
'Musta been somethin' he drunk', I thought<br>
Siah flyin' heads like some ill-ass sport<br>
Minus the asphalt or the towels<br>
All I saw was all the vowels and consonants<br>
Consequently he disembowelled creatures like white owls<br>
Took out about a half-dozen with a scowl<br>
He cleared a path, "Cousin, yo now let's be jetty<br>
End the medley with this freestyle and then we ready<br>

<p>I spent a bit of time looking for a song to write about today. I was playing diffeent random songs in my collection, waiting for the inspiration to hit and say "Yeah, talk about that one."  While I cue up different songs with posts in advance, the words don't come until I discover the need to write about a particular song. Sometimes I'm not even sure about what I'm looking for. Looking back at posts over time, it becomes easier to reflect and say "Well, it was..."</p>
