<p>I don't have much to say about this. The title says it all. The beat itself. The groove. That chorus that I sing out loud while dancing to the song when I play it. All of it. Love Bootsy in the video, although "Kid Funkadelic" is listed on the credits.</p>
<p>I miss the dance floor. I'll play this to remember happier times. Long nights, lazy summer days in fully drenched lush forests or arid deserts. Away from newsfeeds and headlines and all of that. Sometimes I don't want to hear any of that.</p>
<p>I just wanna...I just wanna...</p>
<p>I want to go to a tour date with Deee-Lite and the B-52s.</p>
