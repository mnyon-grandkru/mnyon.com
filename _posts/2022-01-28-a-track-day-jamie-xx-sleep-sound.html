<p>I'm not sure when/how I came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_xx">Jamie xx</a>. I hadn't heard much of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_xx">The xx</a> as my rock quotient had subsided in the mid 2000s and I was immersed in beat oriented music (Hip-Hop, House, Trip-Hop, etc).</p>
<p>This song does invite me to the dance floor. Moving in a place where people create, improvise and expand their language of body movements. In community, in support, in fun.
</p>
<p>I love a unique electronic sound palette, pulling together somewhat seemingly disparate elements together to form a song. The intro of the steel drum sound is a welcome guest. I also appreciate the ways various artists use different techniques to make a track breathe more, whether it's subtle variations in drum patterns, a handy bank of sound effects interspersed, or filters applied in various progressions throughout. Plus, I can nod my head to the hook like it was an old school boom bap hip-hop song, although at slightly faster BPM.</p>
<p>On top of that, the video's how's and why's are part of the entertainment.</p>
