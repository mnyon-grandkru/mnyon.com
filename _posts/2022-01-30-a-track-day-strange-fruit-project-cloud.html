<p>Here's another entry for the "Change the Beat" mixtape (coming later in 2022). I ran into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Fruit_Project">Strange Fruit Project</a> while listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_(group)">Little Brother</a> and everything related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.U.S.T.I.C.E._League">J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League</a>. These were one of the many groups in the mid 2000s who released what I called "Real Hop". People released albums talking about their real experiences, trials & tribulations as opposed to glorifying fantasies.</p>
<p>The first beat is airy indeed, inspiring visions of traveling through the skies. This beat skips while the MCs deftly discuss elevation and dissect between their ways to live in a content way. They're still going up.</p>
<p>The second beat shifts into cruising altitude, bongos replaced with a steadier beat, although some elements carry over from the first beat. The last verse brings it home and can lighten a mood on a cloudy day. Great song.</p>
