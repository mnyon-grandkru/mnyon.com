<p>I first heard of J-Zone while on allhiphop.com, hiphopsite.com, sohh.com or one of the underground hip-hop sites that were in effect in the late 90s/early 2000s. Mix unexpected samples (accordion, anyone?), boom bap, comedy & a NY State of mind (Queens in this case), and you've got J-Zone. MC, Producer and CEO of Old Maid Billionaires, this was my favorite song off <a href="https://j-zone.bandcamp.com/album/pimps-dont-pay-taxes">Pimps Don't Pay Taxes</a>, released in "Two thousand something..."</p>
<p><a href="https://genius.com/J-zone-zone-for-president-lyrics">The first four bars alone</a> let me know I'm in for some entertainment.<br>
  <blockquote>Here comes the Zone up the ave rollin in his pimp Caddy.<br>
    Backpackers wave while I bump that Trick Daddy.<br>
    Prank-callin Funkmaster Flex to get a playback.<br>
    Fuck CD's, next year I'm doin' 8-tracks.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>You had me at Trick Daddy.</p>
<p>The organ under the accordion, the "zone" adlib sample on the "one and" (until the two and three and later in the song), cut-n-paste sample conversations in the background. If Dr. Demento ever did a hip-hop show (did he ever?), J-Zone would have a couple of tracks in that mix.</p>
<p>While Al-Shid & Huggy Bear were the crew on many other tracks on the album, this joint is perfect for chilling solo or with people who want to vibe and chuckle a lil' bit. A nice antidote for a world where...</p>
