<p>Pop music. That's where I started listening. The first song I played on my boombox was "She Bop" by Cyndi Lauper. So I listened to what was on the radio. It took a few years to realize that many of the best radio stations were <a href="https://www.bestcollegereviews.org/these-20-college-radio-stations-rock/">below 92 khz</a>, but in the meantime, back down memory lane I go.</p>
<p>I remember liking the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIOJdMdS56k">breakout single</a>, picking up the album and having it in the background while studying. The 80s synth pads, strings and horns of the first part lead up to the second. The chanteuse repeats the title before the music plays on. Hilarity and several other things may ensue, during after hours.</p>
