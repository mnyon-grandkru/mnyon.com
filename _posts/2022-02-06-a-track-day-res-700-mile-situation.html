<p>I first heard of Res on a song named "Too Late", and picked up her first album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Do">How I Do</a>. This song has a nice dub-futuristic vibe to it. The guitar provides an ethereral backdrop over a soundscape that sounds sparse yet filling at the same time. The background vocals slide in smoothly to herald the hooks' arrival.</p>
<p>This is an early afternoon, head nodding, easy on the ears tune, to me. I get the impression that this is about a long distance relationship, but I could be wrong. I'm not wrong about playing this song while on a roadtrip, a good part of the journey in the past, but still quite a ways to go.</p>
