<p>This gem sent me a <a href="https://lunchclub.com">lunchclub</a> request while listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jZyM6-k50o">Chillhop Essentials Fall 2016 mix</a>. Good downtempo song. I love the non bass bass, the solid thump of the drums. That accent on the hi hat on the two's tickles my ears. The sample that comes in at about 12 seconds in is one of Deeb's adlibs, or sound tags. Going through his catalog, you'll hear them on multiple songs he's released, but it doesn't feel overdone and repetitive.</p>
<p>Moon Buggy Music. That's a mixtape I'd make of songs that are spacious and expansive. The soundtrack to a Saturday afternoon saunter on the sunny side of the moon. If I'm lucky, the buggy would hop and land in sync to the beat. I'd sip on some ginger tea and look out through some heavily visored windows.</p>
<p>Back on earth, this song helps the day go by. Pleasant soundscape to help set a mellow, productive mood.</p>
<p>Quick question; what's the difference between trip-hop & downtempo?</p>
