<p>This isn't the original Price is Right house mix I've heard. The first one I heard was on a mix by this cat named <a href="https://www.dylandrazen.com">Dylan Drazen</a>. His was the first deep house mix I listened to in 2001 - 2002. I got to meet him a decade later on a rooftop in Brooklyn at 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I got to thank him for the music he's made. Go on over there and check out his deep house sets when you can.</p>
<p>The closest thing I could find to this was this remix, which is a little longer, but doesn't have people singing the hook along with the horn. "Ba Da Ba-Daaaaaaah! Ba Da Ba Daaaaaaah! Ba Da Ba De Ba, Ba Da Ba-Daaaaaah!", et cetera.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eddkalehoff.com/about">Edd Kalehoff</a> wrote the original song, which I got to hear whenever I had a sick day and could watch The Price is Right at 11:00 AM. <a href="http://www.eddkalehoff.com/music">He's written a lot of theme music.</a></p>
<p>All in all, those horns & music progressions make for a silly good morning old man two step right in between the morning workout and breakfast. It's a nice pick-me up to get out of the doldrums, or a sonic snack whenever it fits your diet. Enjoy.</p>
