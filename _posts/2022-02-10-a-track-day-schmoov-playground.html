<p>I first heard this song at the beginning and end of a mixtape. The pads meander through the sounds of kids playing, setting up a mellow mood before the beat kicks in. Now we're going.</p>
<p>A hook with a vocal sample? Check.</p>
<p>Vocal effects with a vocoder, auto-tune and the kitchen sink. Robotic funk? Check.</p>
<p>Message to take home with me throughout the day? Check.</p>
<p>I dealt with the pandemic by walking 1 - 2 hours per day. During Spring of 2020, I'd bop to this song while traipsing through my neighborhood, nodding at people I knew as I passed by, enjoying a good mood. Try it sometime.</p>
