<p>I think I first heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1IwholxnjA">Heed the Word of a Brother</a> by X Clan.  Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7iAvR_AKzg">You Gots To Chill</a> from EPMD. My little brain kept connecting the dots through that bassline.</p>
<p>It was a weekend afternoon; people were playing music on the block while cleaning up the house when I actually heard Roger's voice. A voice with a purpose. A direction. A bounce. A song that is automatic sunshine.</p>
