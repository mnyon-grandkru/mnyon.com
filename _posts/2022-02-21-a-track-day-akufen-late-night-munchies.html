<p>This nugget showed up in one of my music services recommendations awhile back. It reminds me of songs I heard during the tail end of the 2000s. Deep House music was going through a minimal phase where spare and sparse drum kits stuttered staccato rhythms to form songs that were <a href="https://genius.com/Company-flow-the-fire-in-which-you-burn-lyrics">"a beautiful use of negative space"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akufen">Akufen</a>'s music fits neatly into that category. Small, quick samples layered on each other make the lattice work of percussion serve throughout the song. The melody is a post-modern mix of horns, organs and choruses. There's variety and progression, especially during the bridge/breakdown session. The two act journey resolves itself with most of the song elements in place, and settles in nicely for a landing.</p>
<p>This could also be on a mix called "Moon Buggy Music". That title keeps sticking with me.</p>
