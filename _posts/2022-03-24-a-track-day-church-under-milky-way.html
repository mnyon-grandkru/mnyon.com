<p>1988; the days where one went to MTV to check out new music & videos. It was a Saturday afternoon.  I used to watch martial arts movies on Channel 5 or 9 in NYC.  Flipping in between channel, I'd come upon this video.</p>
<p>Slow and ethereal. The singer's voice fits into the song well. The bagpipes during the bridge, a woodwind behind the last verse. A flanged out guitar to ride out the rest of the song.</p>
<p>I've not been at this for a minute; life intervened. Luckily, this song is also great for pensive days when thoughts are heavy on the mind to contemplate without getting sucked into the doldrums. Sometimes it feels better to be Under the Milky Way than on earth.</p>
<p>P.S. -  even though I'm not expressing all happiness, I am okay overall. Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>P.P.S - I think that "New Wave" as a genre might be too vague".
