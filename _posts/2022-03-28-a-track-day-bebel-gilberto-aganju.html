<p>This was the best track on a downtempo trip-hop album I purchased while downloading MP3s from <a href="https://emusic.com">eMusic</a>. Before Soundcloud, eMusic was a place where I could find all sorts of non mainstream electronic music.</p>
<p>I imagine that the synths are a relatively modern addition to bossa nova. I'm not sure if there are those who feel that the song and guitar is enough. As is, I like how everything comes together. I just have to brush up on my Portugese or translate the lyrics.</p>
<p>This song can help set the tone for the day, mood wise. Weather warm enough to not feel armored within layers of clothes, sun shining. Good times.</p>
<p>I need to find that album to see if there are other gems on there.</p>
