<p>It's been a minute and five-halves.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfOvPDAAfMs">Insert Rakim quote here.</a></p>
<p>While traveling and keeping my sanity as the world worlds, I've been continuing to enjoy <a href="https://linktr.ee/kiffenbeats">Kiffen Beats</a> mixes a lot. One evening, I was journaling and thinking over past memories and regrets, spending little time in the present. 
As I sank into roleplaying scenarios and sorrow, this song came on in the mix. The beat, the samples, the chords are simple and effective. As the title of the track repeated, I realized that...</p>
<p>"Hey...I don't have to have this experience. I can just..."</p>
<p>I'm glad that I was in a space to receive a message that was being sent. My mood lightened and I bopped my way through my evening.</p>
<p>I've also got another mantra/saying/slogan to help through these days.</p>
<p>Even if "House music/EDM isn't your thing"...this might be worth a quick listen.</p>
<p>Worked for me...</p>
