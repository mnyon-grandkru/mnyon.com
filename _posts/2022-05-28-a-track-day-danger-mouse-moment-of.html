<p>This might be heresy to some, but while I've always admired Jay-Z's lyrical skills since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emlDKySa8GE">Hawaiian Sophie</a>, I've not picked up many of his albums for a listen through. I need to catch up on other well known artists and see if I can gain more from them in my old age. Meanwhile, I'm enjoying Danger Mouse as the production part of the duo <a href="https://dangermousejemini.bandcamp.com/">Danger Mouse & Jemini</a>. The Funk Soul Sensation was one of my favorite joints in particular.</p>
<p>Danger Mouse released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grey_Album">The Grey Album</a> in 2004. At this time, hip-hop heads downloaded mixtapes from places like <a href="https://www.datpiff.com/Jay-Z-The-Grey-Album-mixtape.1852.html">DatPiff.com</a>. The Grey Album became the first Jay-Z album I listened to from start to finish. Moment of Clarity became one of those songs I'd play on repeat, incessantly. The chopped and reconstructed guitar, organ and vocal sample form a highly energetic track that bumps from start to finish.</p>
<p>I've played this song a lot when I've been down. It can get me out of bed in the morning. Sometimes it brings tears to my eyes when I reminisce about overcome hurdles. Those tears aren't a bad feeling though; they're ceremonial markers of times spent, lessons learned and paths to explore.</p>
