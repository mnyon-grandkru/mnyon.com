<p>Sometimes when I get home, I don't need to think. It helps to stare at a screen for a little, before getting into the night's activities.</p>
<p>One of the actors/comediennes I like to watch is  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClZ0t0cnF_L_ObLmEjylfSA">Lisa Yaro</a>. She had a few short
  sketches called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lASLpCQf0zQ">Back</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GNo9ijNI4qI">handed</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Wvee664LgHw">compliments</a>. Nice concept.</p>
<p>I also loved the bass and pad combination. The pause on the four at the beginning. I did some digging and found the original song. C'est un chanson francais! Incroyable!</p>
<p>I can be honest and say it almost doesn't matter what is being said here because the beat mesmerizes me. Nappyboy does have a voice that complements the track.</p>
<p>So check the song out, then check out Lisa, her sketches and her outfits. Peace.</p>
