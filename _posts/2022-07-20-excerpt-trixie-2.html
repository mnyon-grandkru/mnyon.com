<div dir="ltr" style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">"CUT THE SHIT, MOM! WE HAVE THREE MINUTES! Help me with this."</span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">A second Trixie walked out of the basement and moved to pick up the legs. She preferred that to holding the head. That always squicked her out, looking into their eyes like that.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">"This is simpler now" , Trixie thought as she carried her proto-corpse to the disposal chute. "All that testosterone was a serious distraction that I didn't need. Now I'll hopefully have enough time to make some things happen before my next body comes to me. And then I can-"</span><br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">- STOP THAT-&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- 60 SECOND PREPARATION SEQUENCE ENGAGED -</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- GOOD LUCK, TRIXIE -</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trix 2's body surrendered to the Update prep routine and followed her mother through an open door leading down to the Update chamber. Her eyes wandered over the cozy couches and around the room in the way that eyes do when the rest of her body's stuck in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">pre-flight&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Update.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- 30 SECONDS, TRIXIE. HOPE YOU GOT YOUR ACT-RITE -</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"As soon as I can use my teeth again, I'm gritting my teeth for several minutes straight. Damn program, combing through my memories. I've almost got a mind to-"</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">- 15 SECONDS UNTIL -</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trixie sat down on her spot in the Update chamber. Her arms sunk into the armrests and &nbsp;the viscous restraining fluid spread over her wrists and ankles. The chair reclined and lowered an almost horizontal position and lowered to the ground, which activated a glowing blue bioluminescent field that enveloped both Trixie and her mom.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">"Blue in the face, blue in the thighs, blue in the eyes...bye bye!"</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The lights went out.</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Trixie remembered playing with these museum artifacts called plasma balls, from when our people didn't know any better, and invited cancer to their bodies. People could touch the ball, and the charge from the ball would make their hair raise. The Update did her hair dirty in a similar fashion, her black curly ringlets suspended in mid air, surprised and swaying slowly. The chair made sure her hair stayed out of the way. That was one <b>UU</b> (Upgrade Upgrade) she was glad to own. "I mean, think of all the people who don't have their own Chambers, and have no <b>UUs</b>&nbsp;so sometimes they end up with vom in the-"</span><br>
