<p>I had a great Sunday recently. I met up with one of my best friends. We went to Prospect Park where we danced to house, soul and funk. We then met up with my brother from another mother and his girlfriend at a pop up weed emporium. Sampled and bought some stuff, then walked around the corner to a small, local watering hole. The bartender hooked us up with extra size drinks. A DJ showed up, started a nice mix.</p>
<p>On the way back from the bathroom, I hear the beep peaking out over the strings. When I expected the drums to come in, I heard them reversed.&nbsp; It made for this song that made me want to dance in the middle of the bar. It wouldn't have been out of place, but I wasn't aware that I could move the way the music was telling me due to my knee recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>It's been in my rotation consistently ever since.<br /></p>
