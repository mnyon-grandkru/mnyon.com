<p>This came up in my Twitter feed.</p>
<p>Me likey.</p>
<p>It's energetic with a purpose.</p>
<p>This song says "I know you ain't seen shit like this before. Take a monent if you need, but catch up".</p>
<p>and keeps on keeping on...</p>
<p>First verse is a sing song chant, second's a rap slice of life. Each verse is a different stage, with multiple journeys along the way.</p>
<p>This song goes on my motivational list for the hook alone; "(I'm not) Average".</p>
<p>I love how this ends. "Yeah, I do all this shit, but don't forget that I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan_Archives">violinist</a></p>
<p>"(I'm not) Average".</p>
