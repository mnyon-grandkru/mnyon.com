<p>The bass thumps. The beat snaps.</p>
<p>Each MC puts on a clinic. Remy Ma's syllables hug the track for much of her verse, and she switches up effortlessly, celebrating her successes. Rapsody exudes
  the same combination of confidence and concrete groundedness assures people that she's set with where she is and where she's going.</p>
<p>This a nice joint that can kick off the start of a DJ set.  Get people up and on the floor, but not turnt up yet.</p>
<p>Premier does his thing as well. This whole track is the definition of simple & effective; a Tim Duncan of a track.</p>
