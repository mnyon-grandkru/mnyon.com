<p>I learned about Illmaculate and Soul Khan through battle rap. Unlike Soul Khan's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiM3sDcEPc4">last battle</a>, this song isn't a Dizaster.</p>
<p>Produced by Chase Moore, this track thumps. Plain and simple. Soul Khan rides the beat like a veteran ball player on the court, flow wedded to the beat. On top of that, he's got something to say, including lyrics like "Pantaleo's alive, and Erica Garner isn't".</p>
<p>After Soul Khan finishes, Illmac comes in with his verses. Illmac is an emcee's emcee. While Soul Khan rocks a verse that's pretty wedded to the beat, Illmac dives in and out of pockets dextrously. Both MCs make their points known.</p>
<p>The appregiated guitar sounds mixing with that deep bass provides a lush soundscape. This is driving music, or walking music in NYC.</p>
