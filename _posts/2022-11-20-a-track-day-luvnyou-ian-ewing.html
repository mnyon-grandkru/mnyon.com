<p>Been a minute. Going to clear my throat, get the rust out of my fingers & keyboard.</p>
<p>This joint and its creator Ian Ewing made it to my ears via <a href="https://chillhop.com/">Chillhop</a>.</p>
<p>Just as the Inuit have 37 words for snow, dive deep into Downtempo/Lo-fi/Chillhop and over time, varieties of Chill become apparent. Some of these varieties aren't necessarily chill.</p>
<p>This song toys with the more somber end of the chill spectrum, but the steady chord progression moves the song along.</p>
<p>This single is likely present on a series of album, compilations and mixes.</p>
<p>The whole soundscape is dipped in a sea of reverb. A pleasant counterpart to my morning affirmation and planning.</p>
