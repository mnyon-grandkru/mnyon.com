<p>Freddie Joachim, the stellar producer from San Diego. One of my favorite hip-hop/downtempo producers.</p>
<p>There's a precision with his loops, so the claps on the the 2 and 4 with accompanying noises add a clock ticking feel
  over pianoish pads. Various vocal moments, sampled and filtered arrive on the track like guests at a New York City house party; later on.</p>
<p>A fuzzy bass evoking a muffled instrument attached to an old Marshall app has those frequencies covered, and they're doing just fine.</p>
<p>This is a song I could see putting in my playlist and hearing while going for a walk while thinking over important life decisions.</p>
<p>It's been awhile since I heard a song from one of my favorites. Glad to check out his new work.</p>
