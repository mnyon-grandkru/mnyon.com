<p>Wonderfully stilted semi-awkward song with reversed percussion. Not so wonderfully stilted review as a result of postus interruptus.</p>
<p>The reversed high-hats serve as a nod to the punk hip-hop connection back in the 80s. Or perhaps not.</p>
<p>The lyrics hit a bit differently in ones fourties than teens.</p>
<p>These jeans still kinda fit, even if the outfit looks different.</p>
<p>These horns still kinda mix, even in the light of the next day.</p>
<p>One question still fits though;</p>
<p>"Where did you get those eyes?"</p>
