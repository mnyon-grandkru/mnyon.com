<p>A track describing my favorite kind of people.</p>
<p>One of my favorite kinds of house.</p>
<p>Everyone's familiar with the kind of deep house that is mellow, contemplative. One can even study to it.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_at_Work">Masters At Work</a>, but definitely check the resume.</p>
<p>This song isn't a "let's chill" song.</p>
<p>This is a "get your ass on this floor and see what we can make with our body movements."</p>
<p>One doesn't listen to this song to decipher the lyrics. The intent is clear.</p>
<p>"Get down, DOWN, down".</p>
<p>The beat has a bunch of syncopation for footwork to play with.</p>
<p>The voices have passion and connection, even in the hook.</p>
<p>I don't have much else to type, cause I need to dance now.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
