<p>Creativity is something sometimes.</p>
<p>I don't try to fight it with some things, so I'll post something here when I'm inspired.</p>
<p>I feel like the good thing about not remembering things, is that a thing that was a thing can be a thing again.</p>
<p>Enter Skyzoo, and new music.</p>
<p>I literally do not know who "The Other Guys" are. Based on what I hear so far, I need to learn more.</p>
<p>I feel like this song had a bunch of cheat codes; whether we're talking about Skyzoo's always fresh and consistent delivery, the choral chorus or the jazz bass, each of these does what's on their respective manuals. </p>
<p>Let's not forget the bars.</p>
<p>Plus a pean to the eighties with a reason to relay these</p>
<p>to the peeps who 'preciate me for the seasoning in stages.</p>
