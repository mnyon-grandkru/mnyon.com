<p>That guitar sound, I think. Whether it's serving as a bassline or something to bounce vocals against, this song was the first video after Smif-n-Wessun changed their name. The video was nice as well, showcasing the group's braggadocio well visually.</p>
<p>This track's good energy for cleaning the house and reminiscing on hip-hop listening nights. I also forget how technically solid Steele is, and how his smooth delivery complements Tek, who's got something to say.</p>
