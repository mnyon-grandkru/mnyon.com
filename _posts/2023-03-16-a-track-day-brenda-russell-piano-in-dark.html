<p>Eighth grade. I'd been playing piano for a few years. In addition to the pop stations in the Albany, NY area, there were easy listening stations that <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/keyboardmag">Keyboard Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/electronicmusician">Electronic Musician</a> said I should check out. My cousin's partner at the time was a DJ named Marc. Some Saturday nights, I'd go to the radio station  with my Yamaha DX-11 and play along with some songs that he'd play. I'd listen to Jean-Luc Ponty, Mannheim Steamroller and a bunch of acts. This was one of the songs I remember from those days.</p>
<p>About 15 years after those visits, I went right on the FM dial again (most of those stations were above 103, just as a lot of college stations were below 92) and noticed that sometime in the range when trip-hop turned into downtempo, many songs had a stronger hip-hop beat. I'm glad that this song never got that treatment though.</p>
<p>The instrumental wouldn't sound out of place on a Mike and the Mechanics album, and Brenda's voice and the piano take up a lot of the soundscape. There's a guitar that licks tenderly here & there. This song takes me back.</p>
