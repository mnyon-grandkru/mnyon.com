<p>Once upon a time I had a bunch of judgemental opinions about music. Heh. One of those opinions had to do with Sade. I never believed that anyone should mess with her tracks.</p>
<p>The first few people who attempted justified my perspective.Some may be on SoundCloud</p>
<p>Oh how times have changed! Technology, music, me, all factors.</p>
<p>In the midst of a decentralization tech project, this song came up on my mix. This quickly became one of my new favorite walking songs while doing errands in NYC.</p>
<p>Kaytranada adds a steady drumbeat replete with echoing clap ("this beat is made for walking") and bar arrangement as the main discernible light touch on this remix. I could see this song in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnfmOjxm-9fCwexfLqE72jA">Kiffen Beats</a> mix. </p>
