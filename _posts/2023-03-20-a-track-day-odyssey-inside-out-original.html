<p>I thought that this was a George Benson song, but that turned out to be "Inside Love". A connection between yesterday's song and today's; a clap on the snare on both songs.</p>
<p>I remember the hook more than the lyrics; I also remember the beat more than the hook. Listening to it now, the violins partway through add a texture that makes this dish tastier without affecting how my butt moves.</p>
<p>I'd also love to hear this song at a roller skating rink, or while on the move.</p>
