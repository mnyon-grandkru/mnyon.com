<p>I think this is dope. Good to walk around town listening to this refreshing old school jam.</p>
<p>New year, old songs, refreshing to walk through the city with these sounds.</p>
<p>The video itself is nostalgic enough. The horns on the hook. The bass under Biz's words.</p>
<p>This reminds me that not every song needs to be super lyrical.</p>
<p>Reminiscing on good times. Reach out to those folk you haven't in a minute, y'all.</p>
