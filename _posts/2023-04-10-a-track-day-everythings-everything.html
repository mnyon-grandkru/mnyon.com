<p>"This is the part where you get in a circle!", "Move your body, move your body!"</p>
<p>These cats...damn.</p>
<p>Innercity Griots was one of those albums I was late on. Why? <a href="https://www.passionweiss.com/2019/06/12/i-deed-it-the-making-of-freestyle-fellowships-inner-city-boundaries/">That. Damn. Single.</a></p>

<p>...but I digress...</p>
<p>Freestyle Fellowship. Their picture's in the dictionary under "pioneer". This album was in steady rotation for several months.  Each song has <i>character</i>. This one in particular, though?</p>
<p>The switch from call &amp; response to rapid-fire chopping flows, the organic bassline. The mid song breakdown with their names (although the last one eludes me). The horn playing over the soundscape at the end. This is a traveling song, both the activity and the journey it takes.</p>
<p>I'm not going to describe too much more...but "everything is gonna be all right".</p>
<p>Long story short, this song is pretty cool.</p>
