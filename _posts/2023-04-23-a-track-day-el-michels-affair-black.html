<p>Creative videos are back (or never left, depending on your view).</p>
<p>Shout out to the water panther.</p>
<p>This is a good complement to Spring weather. A dub in hand or in head (optional).</p>
<p>A ginger tea flavored carbonated drink sliding down the throat.</p>
<p>Nodding my head to the beat. Feeling the pimp refrain and the breakdown at the end with the guitar kicking up dust at the end.</p>
<p>Although I don't know how dust would survive that hyperbolic Black Thought chamber.</p>
<p>Who cleans the lairs when people are out of town? </p>
