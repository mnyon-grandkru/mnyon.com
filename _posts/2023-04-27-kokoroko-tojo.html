<p>Removed "A Track a Day" from the title because posting isn't that frequent. That's okay; it gives me time to do different things.</p>
<p>Initially, I wanted to share impressions, experiences, and music that affects my mood or day enough to speak on it.</p>
<p>I saw this out in the socal media streets, which made me think about people's relationships to music.<br>

   		<p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I&#39;m one of those people who got older and lost interest in most newer music. I don't feel bad about it. It's not the worst thing, and I've got other things to do.<br><br>But even when I try to find new stuff, it's tough. The spotify algo just throws anything at the wall.

<p>I can understand that perspective. I know that things are supposed to change as we get older, but I don't know what my life would be without these songs to brighten my day.</p>
<p>Today's source of momentary bliss comes from Kokoroko, a Brownswood recording band with Afrobeat * Jazz. A vibe to say the least. A full yet relaxed horn section captures my attention, seated comfortably above a smooth drum beat. This song says "Come here. Let's chill. Don't you like the arpeggiated chords tickling the beat's backside or the space kazoo floating in the midst? Life'll be there; just give me a few minutes."
</p>
<p>If I had a moon hovercraft, I'd play this during the last five minutes right before landing at home. I'd try to time the breakdown at the end would occur as my craft slid into its dock. I'd be missing the sun though.</p>
<p>The next time I'm on a boat in between Grenadine islands, I'll have this on deck.</p>
