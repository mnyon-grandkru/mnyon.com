<p>Evidently, this beat is a J.I.D. song. I need to listen to homeboy.</p>
<p>So, we've got four spitters. Old school, boom bap, hip-hop shit I fell in love with in the first place.</p>
<p>We even got the ringer in the last place, giving younger Busta Rhymes energy.</p>
<p>These cats flow well, both in English (and one in Spanish)</p>
<p>The worldplay is subtle and slick, and they don't do that over-enunciating stuff that some cats with bars do.</p>
<p>The last verse has a nice story to it as well.</p>
<p>Wil Reynolds, a man I admire from a distance, has also found these cats, and I can only imagine he's a Hip-Hop head</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man these coast contra cats... Just some real hip hop that makes me listen. <a href="https://t.co/QRbXGN6aN2">https://t.co/QRbXGN6aN2</a></p>&mdash; Wil Reynolds (@wilreynolds) <a href="https://twitter.com/wilreynolds/status/1655767838416592898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
<p>I'm going to keep nodding as this plays on repeat.</p>
<p>Peace</p>
