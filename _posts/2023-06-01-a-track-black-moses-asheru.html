<p>We've got a guitar lick, the voice and the drums. Each part plays its part, firmly ensconced in its role.</p>
<p>The guitar may have a slight flange on it, like a steel guitar whose strings are steadily and lightly tickled
  with a slow building energy.</p>
<p>The voice is steadfast, hitting each mark like a foot landing with military precision on the beat.</p>
<p>The beat is rhythm, and they all form a sparse yet filling soundscape.</p>
<p>The pockets that Asheru chose go well with the outfit. A knit cap on a light summer outfit.</p>
<p>P.S. Been a lot of hip-hop recently. A lot of the non Hip-hop has been in mixes where I've not split out individual tracks yet.</p>
<p>I'll be splitting those tracks out for more available music.</p>
