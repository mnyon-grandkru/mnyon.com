<p>This is a nice summery track, even though it's a cloudy day.</p>
<p>I'm a fan of vocal arrangements interspersed throughout a track, and the chanting chorus delivers.</p>
<p>That and the melting ivories dripping onto a steady track make for a good time.</p>
<p>The voice is dappled in delay, echo and effect. Makes for a good combination.</p>
<p>I know I like a song when I add in my own effects.</p>
<p>It's been a minute. Glad to be back on it.</p>
