<p>Dylan Drazen began one of my favorite mixes with this song.</p>
<p>It's in my travel mix. Walking through airport terminals to the arpeggiated chords is a good pasttime of mine.</p>
<p>I bounce through the airport terminal, to my gate. Slump into my chair and fall asleep before the plane leaves the ground.</p>
<p>Funny, the journey doesn't feel difficult...</p>
