<p>I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsakyvtqETA">Skratch Bastid's Sunday Evening Soul set.</p>
<p>Gotta give credit to the DJ on knowing how to kick off a groove.</p>
<p>This time of year, even with the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/">Air Quality Index</a> as elevated as people chilling by the grill, pool, park, lounge, club, or wherever they be at, people are still spending time around each other.</p>
<p>It's been a minute.</p>
<p>Solid grooves like this make it easy for that time to pass by. Returning dancers can hit the floor, reconnect with their moves and how those moves moved them, and the others who love those moves.</p>
<p>That guitar comfortably nestled in, chilling around the bass, connects with the beat with a smooth &amp; steady pace that is as reassuring as the promises made in the song</p>
<p>They'll always be right there.</p>
<p>Thankful for that.</p>
