<p>This is one of my favorite animated videos, as well as a new favorite outside my normal rounds.</p>
<p>Glad to get back into guitar based music. The guitar is great seasoning on this dish, especially on the hook.</p>
<p>Also glad to not give up on music in general.</p>
<p>This song is simple and effective.</p>
<p>I could chill or hike to this, and place this on a mix called "It's Okay".
